## Introduction

If you are here, I am a little bit sorry for you. See, here, we are just a bunch of cats who write code.

If you like any of our code, you are free to use it. If you can find it. We probably lost it when we saw a mouse.

Since computers come with mice, we don't get much done. But we do have fun.

Thank you for stopping by. We look forward to sharing more of our madness with you.
